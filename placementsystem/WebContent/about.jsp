<h1> </br>STUDENT PLACEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
<h2> The proposed system is fully computerized, which removes all the drawbacks of existing system. 
  Proposed system is an online application that can be accessed throughout the organization and outside as well with proper login provided. 
  Students logging should be able to upload their information. Visitors/Company representatives logging in may also access/search any information put up by Students.
  The home page contain various links such as links to login ,various services like events happened, achievements and recruiter details etc.
  The administrator will create the users and the users will use the accounts created by administrator. 
   When the user entered into his respective page he has to update his details. And the details are to be approved by the administrator. 
   All the users have some common services like changing password, updating details, searching for details, checking the details, mailing to administrator, and reading the material uploaded by admin if the user is a student.
